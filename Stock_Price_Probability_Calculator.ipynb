        "Generally, stock returns are modeled using a normal distribution. This is because the Central Limit Theorem says that the sum of many small, independent random variables tends to be normally distributed. As a result, daily stock price movements, influenced by a variety of small, independent factors, thus follow a normal distribution. (Stock prices, on the other hand, follow a log-normal distribution - but this is another topic.)\n",
        "\n",
        "Let $R$ denote a random variable representing the stock's returns. Then $$R \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$$ where $\\mu$ (the mean) is the stock's expected return and $\\sigma$ (the standard deviation) is the stock-specific daily volatility, also called the idiosyncratic volatility. Note that the idiosyncratic volatility is different than implied volatility. (The varience is calculated as standard deviation squared or $\\sigma^2$.)\n",
        "\n",
        "We already know that $\\sigma = 0.02$. To calculate $\\mu$, note that the beta, $\\beta$, represents the stock's sensitivity to the market (note that $\\beta$ can be negative in some cases). Hence, we just use the formula $$\\text{Expected return} = \\beta \\times \\text{Market return}$$ which gives us $\\mu = 2\\times 0.01 = 0.02$.\n",
        "\n",
        "For a stock's current price to reach a target price, it needs a return of $$\\frac{\\text{target price}}{\\text{current price}}-1.$$ Since our stock's current price is $\\$100$ and our target is $\\$103$, we need a return, $x$, of $\\frac{103}{100}-1=0.03$.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now we can calculate the probability. It is given by $$P(R> 0.03)=1-P(R\\le 0.03)=1-\\Phi \\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)=1-\\Phi \\left(\\frac{0.03-0.02}{0.02}\\right)=1-\\Phi (0.5)$$ where $\\Phi$ is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution. Using standard normal distribution tables or a computer program, we have $$\\Phi(0.5)\\approx 0.6915$$ so $$P(R> 0.03)=1-0.6915=0.3085$$ so there is a $30.85\\%$ chance that the stock exceeds the price of $\\$103$ given the provided information.\n"

        "First define $x=\\frac{p_t}{p_c}-1$ and $\\mu = \\beta \\times k$. Then $$P(R>x)=1-\\Phi \\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)$$ if $p_c<p_t$ and $$P(R\\le x)=\\Phi \\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)$$ if $p_c\\ge p_t$, where $\\Phi$ is the CDF of the standard normal distribution.\n",
